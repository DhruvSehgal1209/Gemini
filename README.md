This is a College Project for course evaluation.
This Project is made by Dhruv Sehgal, Dhruv Kinger, Devansh Mittal, Devang Saini (Students of G-30)
In this project we made a functional clone of Gemini.
The clone is capable to answer your prompts using the Google Gemini API.
The answer to the prompts are given in a real time by actual Gemini AI.
We used React Basics in this Project.
